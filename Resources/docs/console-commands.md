Commands
========

Until now only a subset of the functionality that is available over the XML-RPC API is available as a symfony command. The following commands are available:

* abc:supervisor:status          Shows status of supervisor instance
* abc:supervisor:process:start   Starts supervisor processes
* abc:supervisor:process:status  Shows status of supervisor processes
* abc:supervisor:process:stop    Stops the supervisor processes

Please use the --help option to get detailed information about a command.
